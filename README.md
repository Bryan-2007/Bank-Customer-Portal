- This is a mini project on Bank Customer Portal submitted for my high school final project.
- It is implemented using basic python syntax and Python-Mysql Connectivity.
- It was executed and tested in the simple VScode terminal.
- It was done using the languages - Python(frontend), MySQL(Backend).
- The project provides basic services like:
  1. Viewing account balance
  2. Viewing profile details
  3. Transfer fund to others
  4. Navigate back and forth within the portal

Note: The fund transfer does not involve real currency or real transactions. The info is saved and updated in the backend using MySQL databases.
